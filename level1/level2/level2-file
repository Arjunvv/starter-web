The infectivity is highest two days prior to showing of clear symptoms and one day after, as per one research. This is the time when other members of the family too get infected. There is an introducer within the family and he/she spreads the virus to others,” said Dr Raveendra Mehta, chief of pulmonology at Apollo Hospitals.

He said that 3-5 members of a family getting infected has become a pattern and one or two members who step out infect the others who are homebound. 

Dr Sudha Menon, director of internal medicine at Fortis Hospital, recalled one family where eight people were infected. A young man was the carrier and spread the virus to his in-laws’ family too. “At home, nobody bothers to take precautions. The pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic persons do not realise that they are infectious,” she said.

In another case, 16 members of a family visited Aster CMI hospital’s fever clinic and got themselves tested. All of them tested positive.
