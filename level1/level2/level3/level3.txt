A new trend has spiked in the city which has seen entire family getting affected by the coronavirus. In a recent incident, all 22 members of a mega VVIP family from Bengaluru tested positive and all of them required hospitalisation. The family was treated at a private hospital on Bannerghatta Road and all of them, luckily, got well. The members included a couple of domestic help as well.

A senior doctor who treated the family told the Times of India: “Imagine the financial burden on the family, not just the stress, anxiety and loss of health. This proves that the infection is spreading more indoors where social distancing is not being followed.”
