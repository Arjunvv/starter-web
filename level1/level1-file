Dr Sunil Kumar K., a consultant for interventional pulmonology at the hospital, said, “There is a misbelief that wearing of masks and physical distancing applies when somebody goes outside the home. Many families and individuals are to a large extent compromising on taking precautions.”

“There are multiple families where 8-10 members have got infected but not everyone would require hospitalisation. In many families we have observed that separate rooms and toilets are just not available for home isolation,” said Dr Kavita Patil, director of Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences. In many cases where several members of a family have got infected, travel history has been a factor, she added.
